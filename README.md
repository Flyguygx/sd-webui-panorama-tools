## Workflows

Some roughly outlined workflows using this extension to generate / fix up panoramas.

Using an inpainting model is recommended.

### Outpainting

1. Enable inpainting in Panorama Tools tab.
2. Import a starting image using the "From *" buttons or by dragging in a starting image.
    * For generated images, send the image to inpainting to copy the prompt/settings.
3. Click Resolution -> From Inpaint Image to set the resolution of the preview & panorama.
4. Adjust field of view & pitch in the inpainting controls until the perspective looks right in the 3d preview.
5. Click "From Output" under the panorama input to apply the inpainting image.
6. Angle the 3D preview to show roughly 1/2 - 1/3 of the previous image.
    * Typically increments of 45 / 60 degrees on the yaw, depending on image contents.
    * May have to zoom out for the poles.
7. Click "Send to Inpainting" under the 3D preview.
8. Mask out the unfilled areas.
9. The following settings are recommended:
    * Masked content - Latent nothing
    * Denoising strength - 1.0
    * Inpaint area - Whole picture
10. Generate the images.
    * May have to adjust the prompt depending on desired image content.
    * i.e. "hallway" tends to always generate images looking straight down a hallway.
11. Select the desired image in the gallery.
12. Go back to the Panorama Tools tab.
13. Under Inpainting, click "From Img2Img".
14. Click the üñºÔ∏è button to copy the camera settings used for the image.
15. Repeat from 5. until the whole panorama is filled.

### Fixing Poles

1. Enable inpainting in Panorama Tools tab.
2. Under Input, import the panorama to edit using the "From *" buttons or by dragging in an image.
    * For generated panoramas, send the image to inpainting to copy the prompt/settings.
3. Under resolution, click "Copy Input Resolution" to set the optimal panorama/preview resolutions.
4. If the poles are missing/cropped out:
    1. Adjust Upper/Lower Pole Offset until the perspective looks right in the 3D preview.
        * Typicially when the horizon/vanishing point is roughly centered vertically with the preview pitch set to 0.
    2. Click "From Output" under the panorama input to apply the adjustments.
    3. Zero out all settings under Adjustments.
5. Angle / zoom the preview to see the pole to inpaint.
    * Up / Down buttons in the Preview settings
6. Click "Send to Inpainting" under the 3D preview.
7. Mask out the pole area.
8. The following settings are recommended:
    * Masked content - Fill / Latent noise / Latent nothing 
    * Denoising strength - 0.7-0.9 / 0.7-0.9 / 1.0
    * Inpaint area - Whole picture / Only masked
9. Update the prompt based on what's visible around the pole and remove any panorama/360 prompts.
10. Generate the images.
11. Select the desired image in the gallery.
12. Go back to the Panorama Tools tab.
12. Under Inpainting, click "From Img2Img".
14. Click the üñºÔ∏è button to copy the camera settings used for the image.
